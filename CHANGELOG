This is version 1.2.0.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1.2.0:

Added two options to allow the generation of random email addresses
with non-random domain names (using the domains from the spammers
list).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1.1.0:

Added spammer-address adding option. Now the script can add the email
addresses of known spammers to the fake listings; so the listings are
fake addresses mixed with spammer addresses. (Use with caution and
only if you know how to search for the real source of spam: remember
most spammers use fake source addresses).


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1.0.0:

Initial release.
